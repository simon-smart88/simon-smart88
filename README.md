Iâ€™m a Software Developer in the School of Medical Sciences at the University of Leicester. My background is in agricultural sciences, especially potatoes. I develop shiny apps, with a particular focus on enabling reproducibility.

### Apps and packages

- Shinyscholar [:computer:](https://github.com/simon-smart88/shinyscholar) [:globe_with_meridians:](https://simonsmart.shinyapps.io/shinyscholar/) a template for making reproducible analytical shiny apps. Forked from Wallace.
- Disagapp [:computer:](https://github.com/simon-smart88/disagapp) [:globe_with_meridians:](https://disagapp.le.ac.uk) for conducting disaggregation regression, which can produce high resolution predictions from data aggregated into polygons.
- MetaInsight [:computer:](https://github.com/CRSU-Apps/MetaInsight/tree/shinyscholar) [:globe_with_meridians:](https://crsu.shinyapps.io/MetaInsight_Scholar/) refactoring an existing app for network metaanalysis to the shinyscholar framework.
